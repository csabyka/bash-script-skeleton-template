A simple template that can serve as the base for future shell scripts. Contains proper handling of options, has a help function, logging capabilities, ...

how to use
==========

There's no real "guide" here. Just have a look at "template.sh", copy the bits you like, remove the bits you don't like and use the template as a basis for your future scripts.

The template uses no external sources (so no shFlags etc.) and can run on its own.
